				<p>I met my husband seven years ago when we both worked at Urban Brew Studios, he was much senior than me and I was an assistant runner or something, and he honestly became my best friend.</p>
<p>
A couple of years ago we were both single, and he was like, 'why don't we give it a shot?' I was like, 'no that's weird'. 'He was like no one knows you like me, and no one knows me like you.</p>
<p>
So for a year we were together but weren't official. Then he took me on holiday and asked me to be his girlfriend. And I was like, I really like you. :) </p>
